# Income Tracker Program

This program asks the user how much money they made today and calculates how much they would make in one week if they kept the same pace. It is a simple Python app designed to demonstrate input handling, calculations, and basic error checking.

## How to Run

Use one of the following commands:

python app.py
# or
python3 app.py

Welcome to my Python program!
How much money did you make today? $5
If you make this amount every day, you'll make $35.00 this week!
